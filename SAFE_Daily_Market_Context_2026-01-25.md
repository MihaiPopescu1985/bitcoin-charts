## Executive Summary

SAFE observes a **continuation of the corrective phase**, with Bitcoin making a **new marginal low** while remaining firmly inside the dominant negative-drift regime.

Compared to the previous day, the market shows:
- **Slightly lower price**
- **Further weakening of medium-term trend**
- **Persistently depressed on-chain activity**
- **Very strong rebound elasticity**, statistically

SAFE characterizes the current environment as **deeply stretched but structurally fragile**, with elevated mean-reversion potential but no confirmed trend reversal.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_2  
- **Regime confidence:** 99.6–99.7%  
- **Estimated drift:** −0.112% per day  
- **Estimated volatility:** ~2.92% daily  

The market remains locked in a **corrective / distribution regime**.  
Minor weight in alternative regimes (STATE_3 ≈ 0.3–0.4%) signals **instability**, but not a transition.

## Volatility & Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

**Simulation count:** 20,000  

### Upside touch probabilities
- **+2%:** 66.6%  
- **+5%:** 45.1%  
- **+10%:** 20.9%

### Downside touch probabilities
- **−2%:** 71.3%

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D (raw):** 26.5%  
- **P_REBOUND_10D (raw):** 27.8%  

### Calibrated probabilities
- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** 2.8%  
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** 78.6%

**Interpretation:**  
SAFE continues to flag **extreme rebound elasticity**.  
Statistically, the market is **highly stretched**, favoring short-term mean reversion rather than further smooth downside.

This does **not** imply a structural bottom—only elevated reactivity.

## On-Chain Activity & Structure

On-chain metrics remain **weak and uneven**:

### Latest observations
- **Total transferred amount:** 372k (low)  
- **Volume Z-score:** −1.63  
- **Dominance Z-score:** −0.39  
- **Whale transactions:** 13 (very low)  
- **Mid-size transactions:** 168 (low)  

**Interpretation:**  
Participation remains **subdued**, especially among whales.  
The absence of strong structural sponsorship suggests that any rebound may be **reactive rather than accumulative**.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** ~35%  
- **Leverage:** 1.0×  
- **Direction:** Long-biased  
- **Entry step:** 0.0  
- **Conviction:** 0.0  

SAFE remains mechanically long, but **with zero conviction**, reflecting **maximum uncertainty**.

---

## Final Interpretation

SAFE currently describes the Bitcoin market as:

- Firmly inside a **negative-drift, high-volatility regime**
- Experiencing **continued corrective pressure**
- **Deeply stretched statistically**
- Lacking strong on-chain confirmation
- Operating in a **fragile, reactive state**

In short: **stretched, volatile, and structurally weak**, with rebound potential but no confirmed regime shift.
