---

SAFE identifies a **structural downside break accompanied by regime instability**.
Price reached a **new local low**, volatility expanded, and the market shifted from a stable corrective regime into a **fractured, mixed-regime state**.

Unlike illiquid sell-offs, this move occurred with **strong on-chain participation**, signaling **active repositioning under stress**, not capitulation.

SAFE classifies the market as **high-risk and regime-uncertain**.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_3
- **Regime confidence:** 61.36%
- **Secondary regime:** HMM_STATE_2 (38.64%)
- **Estimated drift (mixture):** -0.115% per day
- **Estimated volatility:** ~2.93% daily

This is a **clear loss of regime dominance**, marking a **transition phase**.
Historical regime-conditioned expectations are less reliable until dominance re-converges.

## Price, Trend, and Positioning

- **Close:** 84,650.16 (down sharply from 89,299.99)
- **TS_50:** -0.0971
  -> Medium-term trend deterioration **accelerates**.
- **Band width:** 0.353
  -> Volatility **expanded materially**.
- **Band position:** 0.000
  -> Price is at the **absolute lower band extreme**.
- **Range score:** 0.177
  -> Market favors **directional movement**, not range behavior.

**Interpretation:**
This is a **structural downside break**, not consolidation or orderly decay.

## Volatility and Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

**Simulation count:** 20,000

### Upside touch probabilities

- **+2%:** 66.5%
- **+5%:** 45.1%
- **+10%:** 20.8%

### Downside touch probabilities

- **-2%:** 71.3%
- **-5%:** 49.4%
- **-10%:** 21.4%

Risk remains **two-sided**, but regime instability increases **path dependency risk**.

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D (raw):** 25.9%
- **P_REBOUND_10D (raw):** 27.7%

### Calibrated probabilities

- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** 3.4%
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** 78.2%

**Interpretation:**
SAFE flags **extreme rebound elasticity**, but in a **regime-transition context**, elasticity signals are **less trustworthy** than in stable regimes.

## On-Chain Activity and Structure

On-chain metrics show **strong, broad participation**:

- **Total transferred amount:** 925,621
- **Volume Z-score:** +1.11
- **Dominance Z-score:** +0.13
- **Whale transactions:** 86
- **Mid-size transactions:** 713

**Interpretation:**
Large and mid-size actors were **actively involved** during the sell-off, consistent with **intentional reallocation**, not forced liquidation.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** 35%
- **Leverage:** 1.0x
- **Direction:** Long-biased
- **Conviction:** 0.0

SAFE maintains baseline exposure mechanically, but **asserts no directional conviction**.

## Final Interpretation

SAFE currently describes the Bitcoin market as:

- Entering a **regime transition zone**
- Experiencing a **structural downside break**
- Exhibiting **high volatility and extreme elasticity**
- Supported by **active on-chain engagement**
- Marked by **maximum statistical uncertainty**

In short: **unstable, reactive, and regime-fractured**, where risk management dominates signal-following.
