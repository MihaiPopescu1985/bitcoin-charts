---

SAFE indicates that Bitcoin remains locked in the **same high-confidence negative-drift regime**, while **price continues to decline**.  
The notable change versus the previous day is a **partial rebound in on-chain activity**, even as price and trend strength weaken further.

This combination points to a market that is still **fragile and volatile**, but where **participation has tentatively returned** without yet translating into directional conviction.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_2
- **Regime confidence:** 99.96%
- **Estimated drift:** -0.108% per day
- **Estimated volatility:** ~2.92% daily

SAFE continues to classify the market as being in a **distribution / corrective regime**.  
Price action remains active, but **trend persistence is statistically weak** and regime transition pressure remains negligible.

## Price, Trend, and Positioning

- **Close:** 92,631.00 (down from 93,673.14)
- **TS_50:** 0.0277 (down from 0.0348)  
  -> Medium-term trend is still positive, but **continues to decay**.
- **Band width:** 0.328  
  -> Volatility remains **elevated and stable**.
- **Band position:** 0.259  
  -> Price has moved **deeper into the lower band region**.
- **Range score:** 0.352  
  -> Market favors **range expansion** over consolidation.

**Interpretation:**  
Price weakness is persistent and orderly, consistent with a **slow distribution process**, not capitulation.

## Volatility and Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

**Simulation count:** 20,000

### Upside touch probabilities

- **+2%:** 66.8%
- **+5%:** 45.2%
- **+10%:** 20.8%

### Downside touch probabilities

- **-2%:** 71.3%
- **-5%:** 49.1%
- **-10%:** 21.1%

Downside probabilities remain **slightly dominant**, but overall risk remains **broadly symmetric**, implying **high movement with low directional clarity**.

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D (raw):** 22.1%
- **P_REBOUND_10D (raw):** 25.1%

### Calibrated probabilities

- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** 6.0%
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** 23.6%

**Interpretation:**  
Calibration shows a **strong rebound skew**, a clear shift from prior days.  
SAFE interprets this as **short-term elastic potential**, but not yet a regime change, more likely reactive upside than structural reversal.

## On-Chain Activity and Structure

On-chain data shows a **notable rebound in activity**, especially relative to the prior day's depressed levels:

### Day-over-day changes

- **Total transferred amount:** up ~92%
- **Volume Z-score:** -1.82 to +0.18
- **Dominance Z-score:** -2.24 to -0.56

### Transaction counts

- **Whale transactions:** 27 (slightly lower, still muted)
- **Mid-size transactions:** 460 (up sharply)
- **Small transactions:** 354,108 (up)

**Interpretation:**  
While whale activity remains subdued, the recovery in **mid-size and overall volume** suggests **renewed participation**.  
However, dominance remains negative, indicating that **large structural actors are not yet leading**.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** ~35%
- **Leverage:** 1.0x
- **Direction:** Long-biased
- **Entry step:** 0.0
- **Conviction:** ~0 (~4e-06)

SAFE remains mechanically long, but **conviction is effectively absent**, signaling **participation without asserted edge**.

## Final Interpretation

SAFE currently describes the Bitcoin market as:

- Firmly locked in a **negative-drift, high-volatility regime**
- Experiencing **continued price and trend decay**
- Showing a **partial rebound in on-chain participation**
- Exhibiting **short-term rebound asymmetry**, but no structural confirmation
- Remaining **low-conviction and statistically undecided**

In short: **volatile, fragile, and reactive**, with improving participation but no confirmed directional shift.
