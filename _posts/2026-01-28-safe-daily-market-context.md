## Executive Summary

SAFE observes **continued consolidation near the recent rebound zone**, with Bitcoin trading broadly flat while remaining embedded in a **dominant negative-drift regime**.

Compared to the previous reading:
- Price is **stable**
- **Medium-term trend weakens further** (TS_50 more negative)
- **On-chain participation strengthens**, especially among whales
- **Elasticity remains moderate**, no longer extreme

SAFE interprets the market as **structurally fragile but actively engaged**, not trending, and not capitulating.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_2  
- **Regime confidence:** ~98.5–99.2%  
- **Alternative regime (STATE_3):** ~0.8–1.5%  
- **Estimated drift:** −0.111% per day  
- **Estimated volatility:** ~2.92% daily  

The market remains in a **corrective / distribution regime**.  
The rising weight of STATE_3 signals **persistent instability**, but not a confirmed transition.

## Price, Trend & Positioning

- **Close:** 89,299.99 (≈ flat vs prior day)
- **TS_50:** −0.0478  
  → Medium-term trend continues to **deteriorate**.
- **Band width:** 0.334  
  → Volatility remains **elevated**.
- **Band position:** 0.153  
  → Price is **well below the band midpoint**.
- **Range score:** 0.301  
  → Market still favors **movement**, though not expansion.

**Interpretation:**  
Price stability is occurring **inside a bearish structure**, consistent with consolidation rather than reversal.

## Volatility & Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

**Simulation count:** 20,000  

### Upside touch probabilities
- **+2%:** 66.4%  
- **+5%:** 45.1%  
- **+10%:** 20.9%

### Downside touch probabilities
- **−2%:** 71.2%  
- **−5%:** 49.3%  
- **−10%:** 21.2%

The distribution remains **highly symmetric**, indicating **continued volatility with low directional edge**.

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D (raw):** 23.8%  
- **P_REBOUND_10D (raw):** 22.3%  

### Calibrated probabilities
- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** ~10.8–11.6%  
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** ~12.9%

**Interpretation:**  
Elasticity is **balanced and compressed**.  
SAFE no longer detects extreme stretch—suggesting the market has **absorbed prior shocks**.

## On-Chain Activity & Structure

On-chain metrics show **strengthening engagement**:

### Latest observations
- **Total transferred amount:** ~715k  
- **Volume Z-score:** +0.33  
- **Dominance Z-score:** positive  
- **Whale transactions:** 88 (↑)  
- **Whale share Z-score:** strongly positive (> +1.3)

**Interpretation:**  
Whale presence has **increased materially**, alongside improving dominance.  
This suggests **active positioning**, not passive churn, though still short of decisive accumulation confirmation.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** ~35%  
- **Leverage:** 1.0×  
- **Direction:** Long-biased  
- **Entry step:** 0.0  
- **Conviction:** ~0  

SAFE remains mechanically long, but **asserts no directional confidence**.

## Final Interpretation

SAFE currently describes the Bitcoin market as:

- Firmly inside a **negative-drift, high-volatility regime**
- Experiencing **sideways consolidation**
- Showing **normalized elasticity**
- Supported by **rising on-chain engagement**
- Remaining **fragile and directionally unresolved**

In short: **volatile, engaged, and undecided**, with participation rising but no regime shift.
