SAFE describes the Bitcoin market as remaining in a **high-confidence negative-drift regime**, while **both price and on-chain participation continue to contract**.

Compared to the previous day, SAFE observes:

- A **clear price decline**
- **Further weakening of trend strength**
- A **material drop in on-chain volume and dominance**
- Persistently **symmetric short-term risk**

Despite strong regime confidence, **conviction remains effectively zero**, indicating a market that is volatile but **statistically low-signal**.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_2
- **Regime confidence:** 99.98%
- **Estimated drift:** -0.108% per day
- **Estimated volatility:** ~2.92% daily

SAFE continues to classify the market as being in a **distribution / corrective regime**, where price activity is elevated but **directional persistence is weak**.

No meaningful pressure toward a regime transition is detected.

## Price, Trend, and Positioning

- **Close:** 93,673.14 (down from 95,147.77)
- **TS_50:** 0.0348 (down from 0.0516)  
  -> Medium-term trend remains positive, but **is eroding rapidly**.
- **Band width:** 0.325  
  -> Volatility remains **elevated and stable**.
- **Band position:** 0.294  
  -> Price sits in the **lower third of its recent range**.
- **Range score:** 0.339  
  -> Market favors **range expansion**, not compression.

**Interpretation:**  
Price weakness is progressing without volatility escalation, consistent with a **slow decay / distributional process**, not panic selling.

## Volatility and Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

**Simulation count:** 20,000

### Upside touch probabilities

- **+2%:** 66.7%
- **+5%:** 45.4%
- **+10%:** 20.8%

### Downside touch probabilities

- **-2%:** 71.1%
- **-5%:** 49.2%
- **-10%:** 21.1%

Downside probabilities remain **modestly higher**, but overall risk is **broadly symmetric**, implying **movement without strong directional clarity**.

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D (raw):** 23.2%
- **P_REBOUND_10D (raw):** 25.4%

### Calibrated probabilities

- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** 10.9%
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** 11.4%

**Interpretation:**  
After calibration, rebound and correction risks are **nearly balanced**, indicating **limited asymmetry**. SAFE does not observe strong downside acceleration, but also **no reliable upside elasticity**.

## On-Chain Activity and Structure

On-chain data confirms a **continued and deepening contraction in participation**:

### Day-over-day changes

- **Total transferred amount:** down 37%
- **On-chain dominance:** down materially
- **Volume Z-score:** -1.82
- **Dominance Z-score:** -2.24

### Transaction counts

- **Whale transactions:** 29 (flat, very low)
- **Mid-size transactions:** 177 (down sharply)
- **Small transactions:** 332,320 (down)

**Interpretation:**  
Both **volume and dominance are deeply negative in Z-score terms**, signaling a lack of large-actor sponsorship.  
This typically coincides with **fragile price discovery** and increased sensitivity to marginal flows.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** ~35%
- **Leverage:** 1.0x
- **Direction:** Long-biased
- **Entry step:** 0.0
- **Conviction:** ~0 (2.7e-05)

SAFE remains mechanically long, but **conviction is effectively absent**, indicating **participation without asserted edge**.

## Final Interpretation

SAFE currently describes the Bitcoin market as:

- Firmly locked in a **negative-drift, high-volatility regime**
- Experiencing **weakening trend and falling price**
- Showing **clear contraction in on-chain participation**
- Exhibiting **high probability of movement but low directional confidence**

In short: **volatile, fragile, and statistically undecided**, with a mild downside bias but no crash signal.
