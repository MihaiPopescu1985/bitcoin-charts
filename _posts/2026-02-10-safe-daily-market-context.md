---

SAFE confirms **continued operation inside the post-crash elastic regime**, with Bitcoin making a **fresh downside extension** while volatility remains extremely elevated.

Compared to the prior reading:

- Price moved **lower**
- Medium-term trend **deteriorated further**
- Volatility **compressed slightly**, but remains extreme
- On-chain participation **declined**, though stayed structurally elevated
- **Rebound elasticity remains near-maximal**

SAFE classifies the market as **post-shock, elastic, but still structurally dangerous**, where statistical upside coexists with severe path risk.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_3
- **Regime confidence:** 99.9999%
- **Estimated drift:** +0.149% per day
- **Estimated volatility:** ~3.78% daily

SAFE remains in a **fully converged post-crash regime**.
This regime historically corresponds to **violent price paths**, where mean reversion is common but timing is unreliable.

## Price, Trend, and Positioning

- **Close:** 68,993.85 (down from 70,138.00)
- **TS_50:** -0.1500
  -> Medium-term trend damage **deepens further**.
- **Band width:** 0.633
  -> Volatility remains **extreme**, though slightly lower than the prior peak.
- **Band position:** 0.139
  -> Price remains **deep in the lower band**.
- **Range score:** 0.0176
  -> Market is **fully non-range**, dominated by directional stress.

**Interpretation:**
This is a **continuation of the stress phase**, not stabilization.

## Volatility and Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

**Simulation count:** 20,000

### Upside touch probabilities

- **+2%:** 74.6%
- **+5%:** 58.6%
- **+10%:** 35.7%

### Downside touch probabilities

- **-2%:** 68.3%
- **-5%:** 49.4%
- **-10%:** 24.5%

Upside elasticity remains dominant statistically, but **downside tail risk is still material**.

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D (raw):** 27.5%
- **P_REBOUND_10D (raw):** 31.2%

### Calibrated probabilities

- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** 19.3%
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** 95.2%

**Interpretation:**
SAFE continues to flag **extreme rebound elasticity**, though slightly reduced from the absolute peak.
This reflects **post-crash stretch**, not safety or trend recovery.

## On-Chain Activity and Structure

On-chain data shows **cooling but still elevated participation**:

### Latest observations

- **Total transferred amount:** 953k (down ~15% day-over-day)
- **Volume Z-score:** +1.09
- **Dominance Z-score:** +0.66
- **Whale transactions:** 83 (down from 107)
- **Mid-size transactions:** 678 (down)

**Interpretation:**
Large-actor participation **declined but remains above baseline**.
This suggests **temporary exhaustion**, not disengagement.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** 35%
- **Leverage:** 1.0x
- **Direction:** Long-biased
- **Conviction:** 0.0

SAFE remains mechanically exposed but **explicitly suppresses conviction** due to regime risk.

## Final Interpretation

SAFE currently describes the Bitcoin market as:

- Fully embedded in a **post-crash elastic regime**
- Experiencing **continued downside stress**
- Showing **near-maximal rebound probability**
- Supported by **still-elevated on-chain participation**
- Carrying **very high path and volatility risk**

In short: **elastic but unstable**, where statistical upside does not equate to safety.
