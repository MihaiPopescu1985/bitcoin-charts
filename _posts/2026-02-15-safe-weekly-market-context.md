---

Over the last week, SAFE confirms sustained operation inside a **fully converged post-crash elastic regime (HMM_STATE_3 ~ 100%)**.

The week was characterized by:

- Persistent **negative medium-term trend**
- **Extreme volatility expansion** early in the week
- Gradual **volatility compression**, but still elevated
- Strong early-week on-chain participation, followed by **structural disengagement**
- Rebound elasticity that remained **statistically high**, though increasingly unstable

SAFE classifies the week as a **post-shock stabilization attempt inside a high-risk regime**, not a confirmed recovery.

## Regime Dynamics (HMM)

Throughout the entire week:

- **HMM_STATE_3 dominance:** ~100%
- **Confidence:** > 99.999%
- **Calibrated mu:** about +0.15% per day
- **Calibrated sigma:** about 3.76% daily

This confirms full regime convergence into a **high-volatility elastic phase**.

There was **no regime fracture** during the week, only stress continuation inside STATE_3.

## Price and Trend Evolution

| Date   | Close  | TS_50   | Band Width |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| Feb 08 | 70,330 | -0.1368 | 0.677      |
| Feb 10 | 68,841 | -0.1513 | 0.634      |
| Feb 12 | 66,272 | -0.1670 | 0.650      |
| Feb 15 | 70,500 | -0.1289 | 0.611      |

### Observations

- **Trend damage deepened mid-week** (TS_50 worsened to -0.167).
- Price printed a **weekly low on Feb 12**, then rebounded.
- Volatility peaked early (band_w ~0.68), then compressed toward ~0.61.
- Band position remained in the **lower tail all week**.

**Interpretation:**
This was a **downside extension followed by elastic rebound**, not structural recovery.

## Elasticity and Touch Probabilities

Conditioning (Feb 14 -> Feb 15):

### 10-Day Touch Probabilities (calibrated)

**Upside**
- +2%: 74.6%
- +5%: 58.6%
- +10%: 35.6%

**Downside**
- -2%: 68.1%
- -5%: 49.2%
- -10%: 24.3%

Upside probabilities remained dominant all week, confirming **elastic mean reversion bias**, but downside risk stayed material.

Notably:

- Early week: calibrated rebound near **95-97%**
- Feb 12: calibration destabilized (correction probability spike)
- Late week: elasticity remained high but less extreme

**Conclusion:**
Elasticity remained statistically elevated, but **confidence in its stability decreased** mid-week.

## On-Chain Structural Evolution

### Early Week (Feb 08-10)

- Volume Z > +1.5
- Whale share Z strongly positive
- Dominance positive

**Interpretation:** strong structural participation.

### Mid Week (Feb 11-13)

- Volume cooled
- Whale participation declined
- Feb 13: volume Z negative

**Interpretation:** participation exhaustion phase.

### Late Week (Feb 14-15)

- Feb 14: temporary rebound in volume
- Feb 15: sharp contraction
  - Volume Z: -1.72
  - Dominance Z: -3.70
  - Whale TX collapsed to 16

**Interpretation:**
The week ended with **structural disengagement**, not aggressive accumulation.

## SAFE Positioning (Unchanged All Week)

- Target exposure: 35%
- Leverage: 1.0x
- Direction: Long-biased
- Conviction: 0.0

SAFE maintained baseline exposure but **never expressed conviction**, consistent with high regime risk.

## Weekly Interpretation

SAFE describes the week as:

- Fully embedded in a **post-crash elastic regime**
- Marked by **extreme volatility**
- Characterized by **deep downside probe -> rebound**
- Showing **declining structural participation into week end**
- Carrying **high path risk despite statistical upside bias**

In short:

The market is elastic but unstable.
Rebound probability is high.
Structural confirmation is weak.
Risk remains dominant.
