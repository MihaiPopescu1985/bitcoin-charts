SAFE identifies a **full regime transition into an extreme stress-elasticity state**.
Bitcoin experienced a **deep downside continuation** followed by an **initial rebound**, while the Hidden Markov Model converged with **near-total certainty** on a single regime.

This reading marks a **qualitative shift** from regime instability to **regime dominance**, but in a **high-volatility, high-uncertainty environment**.

SAFE classifies the current market as **post-shock, highly elastic, and structurally dangerous**, despite elevated rebound probabilities.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_3
- **Regime confidence:** 99.99%
- **Estimated drift:** +0.176% per day
- **Estimated volatility:** ~3.70% daily

This is a **fully resolved regime transition**.
Unlike the prior reading (fractured dominance), SAFE now detects **complete regime convergence**, indicating that the market has entered a **distinct behavioral phase**.

## Price, Trend, and Positioning

- **Close:** 78,511.31 (up from 76,968.21 low)
- **TS_50:** -0.1191
- **Band width:** 0.479
- **Band position:** 0.041
- **Range score:** 0.050

The rebound is **reactive**, not structural. Trend damage remains severe.

## Volatility and Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

### Upside touch probabilities

- **+2%:** 75.1%
- **+5%:** 58.8%
- **+10%:** 35.8%

### Downside touch probabilities

- **-2%:** 67.4%
- **-5%:** 48.0%
- **-10%:** 23.3%

Upside elasticity dominates statistically, but volatility risk remains extreme.

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** 2.0%
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** 92.0%

SAFE detects **near-maximal rebound elasticity**, typical of post-shock conditions.

## On-Chain Activity and Structure

- **Total transferred amount:** 1.34M
- **Volume Z-score:** +2.19
- **Dominance Z-score:** +1.78
- **Whale transactions:** 108

On-chain activity confirms **structural engagement**, not passive churn.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** 35%
- **Leverage:** 1.0x
- **Direction:** Long-biased
- **Conviction:** 0.0

SAFE remains exposed but explicitly non-committal.

## Final Interpretation

SAFE describes the market as **post-crash elastic**:
high rebound probability, extreme volatility, and maximum path risk.
