---

SAFE confirms a **continuation of the post-crash stress regime**, with Bitcoin printing a **new extreme low** and volatility expanding to unprecedented levels in the current cycle.

The defining characteristics of this reading are:

- **Full HMM regime convergence** (STATE_3 at 100%)
- **Maximum volatility expansion**
- **Extreme rebound elasticity**
- **Explosive on-chain participation**, led by whales and mid-sized actors

SAFE classifies the market as being in a **capitulation-elasticity regime**, where statistical upside is very high, but **path risk and instability dominate**.

## Regime Assessment (HMM)

- **Dominant regime:** HMM_STATE_3
- **Regime confidence:** 100.0%
- **Estimated drift:** +0.129% per day
- **Estimated volatility:** ~3.75% daily

This is a **fully resolved regime state**, not a transition.
STATE_3 historically corresponds to **post-crash, high-volatility environments** with strong mean-reversion bias but unreliable price paths.

## Price, Trend, and Positioning

- **Close:** 63,390.52
- **TS_50:** -0.2184
  -> Medium-term trend damage is **severe and accelerating**.
- **Band width:** 0.7438
  -> Volatility is at an **extreme historical expansion**.
- **Band position:** 0.000
  -> Price sits at the **absolute lower band extreme**.
- **Range score:** 0.0019
  -> Market is **fully non-range**, dominated by directional stress.

**Interpretation:**
This is a **deep capitulation zone**, not a consolidation or trend-following environment.

## Volatility and Short-Term Risk (10-day horizon)

**Simulation count:** 20,000

### Upside touch probabilities

- **+2%:** 74.1%
- **+5%:** 57.9%
- **+10%:** 35.0%

### Downside touch probabilities

- **-2%:** 68.7%
- **-5%:** 49.7%
- **-10%:** 24.8%

Upside probabilities dominate due to **elastic mean reversion**, but downside risk remains **material and non-negligible**.

## Correction vs Rebound Dynamics

- **P_CORRECTION_10D (raw):** 32.2%
- **P_REBOUND_10D (raw):** 39.1%

### Calibrated probabilities

- **P_CORRECTION_10D_CAL:** 1.75%
- **P_REBOUND_10D_CAL:** 100.0%

**Interpretation:**
SAFE detects **maximum rebound elasticity**.
This reflects **statistical stretch**, not safety or trend recovery.

## On-Chain Activity and Structure

On-chain metrics show **exceptional structural engagement**:

### Latest observations

- **Total transferred amount:** 1.81M
- **Volume Z-score:** +3.03
- **Dominance Z-score:** +2.54
- **Whale transactions:** 165
- **Mid-size transactions:** 1,769
- **Whale share Z-score:** +3.88

**Interpretation:**
This is **active, large-scale repositioning**, not panic liquidation.
Such configurations are typical of **capitulation and early re-accumulation phases**, but timing remains highly uncertain.

## SAFE Positioning Output (Informational)

- **Target exposure:** 35%
- **Leverage:** 1.0x
- **Direction:** Long-biased
- **Conviction:** 0.0

SAFE maintains exposure mechanically, but **explicitly suppresses conviction** due to extreme regime risk.

## Final Interpretation

SAFE currently describes the Bitcoin market as:

- Fully embedded in a **post-crash elastic regime**
- Exhibiting **record volatility expansion**
- Showing **maximum statistical rebound potential**
- Supported by **very strong on-chain participation**
- Carrying **maximum path and regime risk**

In short: **highly elastic but extremely dangerous**, where risk control outweighs signal strength.
